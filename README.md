# TutorJS

The Front-end code for Openstax Tutor related projects

## Install

1. install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
  - run `nvm install` in this directory to install and use the correct version of node
  - _Alternatively:_ manually install the right version of node in [./.nvmrc](./.nvmrc)
1. Git Clone this repository to the directory of your choice
  - If you donâ€™t have `git` installed you can install homebrew and then `brew install git`
1. `cd tutor-js` move into the checked out directory
1. `yarn install`
1. `yarn run serve <project>` *(where <project is one of tutor|exercises)*

 - Run the Tutor server as shown below

## Development

- `yarn run serve <project>` starts up a local development webserver which rebuilds files when changed
- `yarn test <project>` runs unit tests for all projects
- `yarn run coverage` generates a code coverage report
- `yarn run build <project> archive` builds minified files for production

Use `PORT=8000 yarn start` to change the default webserver port.

After local updates are made:

1. stop `yarn start`
1. `yarn install`
1. restart `yarn start`

#### Cypress tests

Tutor uses [cypress](https://www.cypress.io) for acceptance testing.  The cypress tests can be ran by:
1. start the stubbed backend server: `yarn run tutor:test:server`
1. run the cypress test suite: `yarn run tutor:test:cypress`
  * To write new cypress tests, open the cypress UI by running: `yarn run tutor:test:cypress open`

### Tutor Server

Using the sample API data only allows acting as a student and can't save data.  For a more realistic development experience you'll also need to run the [Tutor server](https://github.com/openstax/tutor-server)

1. Install Tutor Server as shown in its README file
1. Start both the tutor-server Rails application and run `yarn run serve tutor` in this project's directory
1. Load <http://localhost:3001> in your browser
  - Once you click login, the server will present a dev console that allows you to select a user
1. And will then render the FE just as it appears in production

### Exercises

`tutor-js` is also the front-end for [Exercises](https://github.com/openstax/exercises) and is ran similarly to the Tutor Server.

1. Install OpenStax Exercises as shown in its README file
1. Run `yarn run serve exercises` in `tutor-js` directory
1. Load <http://localhost:3000> in your browser
